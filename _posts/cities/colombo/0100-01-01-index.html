Each year, an increasing number of people move to Colombo, where the current population
estimate is between 750,000 and 1 million inhabitants, up to 2 million when accounting for the
surrounding metropolitan district. Much of this growth has been the unplanned proliferation of
slums, lacking appropriate infrastructure and public utilities. Further, as a coastal city lying only
1.5 meters above sea level, Colombo is at high risk for floods and cyclones and the risk of these
events is intensifying as climate change increases the volatility and frequency of severe weather.
The challenges of urbanization and resilience facing Colombo grow with the city. Colombo
needs to act now to achieve its vision of becoming a competitive, sustainable, and well-linked
city, providing every family with a decent standard of living.
